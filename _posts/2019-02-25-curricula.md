<p>I believe higher education curricula in the humanities, media production, and computation should:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>1. Emphasize four synchronous domains of engagement: Making, knowing, inquiring, and becoming;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>2. Encourage students <em>to hypothesize wildly</em> but require them <em>to test against those hypotheses aggressively and with rigor</em>;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>3. Encourage students to self-identify as local experts; create spaces for them to share that expertise; build assignments that require students consult with one another;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>4. We have long modeled literate ideals in our courses. Now, in the era of digital networks, faculty should learn how to model our critical and productive relationship with technology, data, social media and consumer culture;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>5. Faculty must acknowledge that "learning over the lifetime" means academics, too: In addition to performing our expertise, we must not shy from modeling our student-selves. We must be responsible to communities beyond our own disciplines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>6. Higher education can reimagine itself as as a well-spring of human dignity and agency in the information age by focusing on the quality of inquiry, and let other domains contend with the answers. In the course of discovering and posing questions, we are most fully human.</p>
