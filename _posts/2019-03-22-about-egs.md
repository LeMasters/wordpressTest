<h3>My Time at EGS</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between 2007 and 2010, I took seminars in Switzerland with Badiou, Agamben, Avital Ronell, Greg Ulmer, Zizek, and Wolfgang Schirmacher, among others. &nbsp;Prof. Schirmacher was faculty with &nbsp;the Media Studies Graduate Program at the New School, in addition to being the founding Dean of the Media and Communications Division of EGS; he also directed my dissertation, which was defended and accepted in December, 2010.</p>
